# dev-setup
A fairly simple bash script for getting a fresh install of OSX Ventura ready for statvis development.

## Usage:
Open a terminal, enter this command:
`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Statvis/dev-setup/main/setup.sh)"`

Note: keep an eye on your terminal while it runs; there are a few spots where you will be prompted to continue. For the github login, use the defaults recommended in their prompt.
